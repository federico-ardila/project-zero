        I'm here at Fedes place. He's cooking up some legendary
        pasta while teaching me in hacking the world globaly.
        I learned a couple of things already.
        Creating folders, copying and pasting the basic foundation
        of an html-page into this project, which I moronicaly
        called 'projectzero'
